# Usage: ./CI/ft-regression.sh <commit to test against>

# The following script checks the source code in the current folder for
# regressions or changes against previous commits. This is the main script you 
# should be calling and the rest are more for utility.

# These scripts requires xvfb (for capturing demos), imagick 
# (for comparing images) and pretty-diff which can be installed via npm  
# (for diffing text)

# Below is utility function used to build both versions of freetype and 
# respective demos exes linked against the specific builds

  # fails, then there's nothing to compare so no point in continuing.
